    Data validation is complete; now it's time to predict. To help farmers plan ahead, the Ministry needs models that forecast crop yield. In this project, you build the foundation of supervised machine learning using scikit-learn to fit simple linear regressions. You will calculate Pearson correlation coefficients, isolate rainfall drivers using Least Squares, implement an 80/20 train-test split, and run residual diagnostics to validate model assumptions. It is the exact predictive baseline that the rest of the regression work builds on.

    The Ministry of Agriculture's audit concluded with a clear message: the field data is sound, the weather stations are calibrated, and the pipeline is production-ready. Now comes the harder question.

    Sanaa drops a printout on your desk — a summary of the Maji Ndogo farm survey. "We can validate the data all we like," she says. "But what the farmers actually need is a prediction. If I can tell a maize farmer in Kilimani that his expected yield next season is 4.2 tonnes per hectare, he can plan accordingly. If I can tell the ministry which environmental factors drive yield the most, they can direct investment."

    She taps the printout. "We have weather readings, soil measurements, plot sizes, and three seasons of yield records. Build me a model."

    This is where data science becomes machine learning. You are not just describing what happened — you are learning from it to predict what will happen next. In Part A, you will work with a single predictor at a time: the simplest possible model, but the essential foundation. By the end of this notebook you will have:

    - Visualized and quantified linear relationships between individual farm features and crop yield.
    - Fit your first regression model using the Least Squares method in scikit-learn.
    - Evaluated model performance using R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
    - Used a train-test split to confirm that performance generalizes to unseen fields.
    - Diagnosed model assumptions through residual analysis.

    > **AI assist:** This module introduces the full supervised learning workflow for the first time. Use an AI assistant as a thinking partner.

    ## Data Setup

    ### Data Dictionary

    The dataset is loaded directly from the Maji Ndogo farm survey database — the same source used throughout the programme. Each row represents one field.

    **Target variable**
    - `Standard_yield`: The normalized crop yield score for each field, ranging from 0 to 1. This is what we are predicting.

    **Environmental features**
    - `Rainfall`: Annual rainfall in mm (Float).
    - `Ave_temps`: Average temperature in degrees Celsius (Float).
    - `Elevation`: Field elevation above sea level in meters (Float).
    - `Slope`: Slope of the land in degrees (Float).

    **Soil features**
    - `Soil_fertility`: Normalized fertility index, 0–1 (Float).
    - `pH`: Soil pH level (Float).
    - `Pollution_level`: Normalized pollution index, 0–1 (Float).

    **Farm features**
    - `Plot_size`: Field area in hectares (Float).
    - `Crop_type`: Type of crop grown (String — categorical).
    - `Location`: Province where the field is located (String — categorical).
    - `Annual_yield`: Raw annual yield in tonnes (Float).

    **Setup:** Run the cell below to load the data before attempting any challenge.

    **The database is bundled with this notebook** as `Maji_Ndogo_farm_survey_small.db` — the setup cell below reads it directly, offline. You do not need to download anything.

    ## Challenge 1: Visualizing the Relationship

    Every predictive model starts with a question: *Is there even a relationship to model?*

    Before fitting any line, we need to look at the data. We have many features, but let's begin with `Ave_temps` — average temperature across the field's growing season. Temperature directly affects crop growth rates, photosynthesis efficiency, and evapotranspiration. It's a logical first candidate.

    ### Task
     Create a function named `temp_yield_correlation` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame and the names of the temperature column and the yield column as parameters.
    - Generates a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the two variables, with axis labels and a title.
    - Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between them.
    - Returns the Pearson correlation coefficient as a float.

    **Note:**
    - Use `matplotlib` for plotting.
    - Use `scipy.stats.pearsonr` or `numpy.corrcoef` for the correlation coefficient.
    - Ensure your function returns the Pearson correlation coefficient as a float.

    ## Challenge 2: Rainfall as a Predictor

    ### Task
     Create a function named `rainfall_yield_relationship` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame and the names of the rainfall column and the yield column as parameters.
    - Generates a scatter plot visualizing the relationship and overlays the fitted regression line.
    - Fits a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.
    - Returns the slope and intercept of the fitted model as a tuple `(slope, intercept)`.

    **Note:**
    - Use `matplotlib` for plotting.
    - Use `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` for modeling.

    ## Challenge 3: Evaluating Rainfall's Predictive Power

    A regression line can always be drawn through data. The question is whether that line is *useful*. Let's measure how well rainfall predicts yield using four performance metrics:

    - **R-squared (R²)**: The proportion of variance in yield explained by rainfall. Ranges from 0 (no explanatory power) to 1 (perfect).
    - **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error — average magnitude of prediction errors, in the same units as yield.
    - **MSE**: Mean Squared Error — penalizes large errors more heavily than MAE.
    - **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error — the square root of MSE, in the same units as yield.

    ### Task
     Create a function named `evaluate_rainfall_model` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame as input.
    - Trains a simple linear regression model using `Rainfall` as the predictor and `Standard_yield` as the target, on the **entire dataset**.
    - Calculates R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

    ## Challenge 4: The Train-Test Split

    So far we have trained and evaluated our model on the same data. That is like a teacher grading students on the questions they practiced — it tells us how well the model memorized the training data, not how well it will predict yields for fields it has never seen.

    The **train-test split** fixes this. We hold out a random 20% of the data, train on the remaining 80%, and evaluate only on the held-out set. If performance is similar to the full-data evaluation, our model is generalizing — not just memorizing.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `train_test_split_evaluate` that:
    - Takes in the DataFrame.
    - Separates it into features (`X`) using `Rainfall` and target (`y`) using `Standard_yield`.
    - Splits the data into training and testing sets using `test_size=0.2` and `random_state=42`.
    - Trains a simple linear regression model on the training set.
    - Evaluates the model on the test set, calculating R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

    ## Challenge 5: Diagnosing Model Fit Through Residual Analysis

    Our metrics give us a high-level picture. Residual analysis gives us the X-ray. **Residuals** are the differences between actual yield values and our model's predictions:

    ```
    residual = actual_yield - predicted_yield
    ```

    A well-specified linear regression model should produce residuals that:
    1. Are **roughly normally distributed** — a bell curve centered near zero.
    2. Have a **mean close to zero** — meaning the model is not systematically over- or under-predicting.
    3. Do not fan out or curve — no systematic pattern suggesting a non-linear relationship.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `analyze_model_residuals` that:
    - Uses `predictions` and `y_test` from Challenge 4 to calculate residuals (`y_test - predictions`).
    - Plots the residuals as a histogram with a vertical line at zero, axis labels, and a title.
    - Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the residuals.
    - Returns `(mean_residual, std_residual)`.

    ## Wrapping up

    You have built and evaluated your first machine learning model on the Maji Ndogo farm survey data. This is Part A of a three-part modeling arc:

    | Part | Scope | Status |
    |---|---|---|
    | **Part A (this notebook)** | Single-predictor simple linear regression | ✅ Complete |
    | **Part B (Module 2)** | Multiple linear regression with feature selection | Upcoming |
    | **Part C (Module 3)** | Regularization (Ridge & LASSO) and model persistence | Upcoming |

    ### What you learned this module

    - **Pearson correlation** measures the *strength* and *direction* of a linear relationship — not causation.
    - **Simple linear regression** finds the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (Least Squares).
    - **R-squared** tells you how much variance your model explains. An R-squared near zero means the single predictor is not enough — but a detectable signal means it is worth keeping.
    - **The train-test split** simulates real-world generalization. Similar train and test performance means no overfitting.
    - **Residual analysis** is the X-ray: if residuals are symmetric around zero with no pattern, the linear framework is appropriate.

    Sanaa's next question: "Can we do better with more predictors?" In Module 2, we will bring in the full feature set and use Multiple Linear Regression to close the gap.
